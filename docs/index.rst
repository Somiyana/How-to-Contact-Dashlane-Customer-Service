Most issues can be resolved using the Help Center, and if you don’t find a solution, it may direct you to the next step, which is contacting customer service.
2. Contacting Dashlane Support via Email

For more personalized support, Dashlane offers a customer service team that can be reached via email. This is a good option if you need assistance with account-related issues or require detailed technical support. While the Help Center covers most general inquiries, the email option is great for cases that require in-depth attention or troubleshooting.
How to Contact Dashlane via Email:

    Submit a Request: In the Help Center, you will find an option to "Contact Support." Clicking this will guide you to a form where you can submit a request.

    Fill Out the Form: When filling out the form, provide as much detail as possible. Include the issue you’re experiencing, what troubleshooting steps you’ve already taken (if any), your device and OS version, and any other relevant information.

3. Live Chat Support

For real-time assistance, Dashlane offers live chat support.

The live chat feature connects you directly with a Dashlane representative who can help you troubleshoot issues or answer questions.
How to Use Live Chat Support:

    Open Dashlane: Log in to your Dashlane account, either on the web or through the app.

    Navigate to the Support Section: Look for a "Chat with Us" or "Live Chat" option, typically located at the bottom right corner of the support page or Help Center.

6. Dashlane Knowledge Base

Alongside its Help Center, Dashlane also provides a Knowledge Base, which is a more technical resource that includes in-depth guides and troubleshooting steps for advanced users. If you’re comfortable exploring more complex settings or want to learn about the technical aspects of Dashlane’s features, the Knowledge Base is a good resource.
